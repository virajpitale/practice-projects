# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains an updated deep learning project aimed at predicting bank customer churn. The project explores advanced techniques for handling imbalanced data, such as undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, and ensemble methods, to improve model performance and the accuracy of classification reports.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem for many businesses, and accurately predicting it can lead to significant cost savings. This project builds on previous work by applying methods to address the common issue of imbalanced data, leading to better precision, recall, and F1-scores.

## Key Features

- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Techniques like undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, and ensemble methods are applied to balance the dataset.
- **Enhanced Model Performance:** The application of these techniques leads to improved classification metrics, ensuring the model performs well across both majority and minority classes.
- **Clear and Understandable Code:** The code is written with clarity in mind, making it accessible and easy to follow for others looking to learn or replicate the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle: [Bank Customer Churn Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling). It includes features such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, and churn status.

# **TF-IDF Exercise**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive exercise on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), a widely used technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for transforming textual data into numerical features. TF-IDF is especially useful for text classification and information retrieval tasks, where it helps in identifying the most relevant words in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).

## **Objective**
The main objective of this exercise is to understand and implement the TF-IDF technique to convert raw text data into a structured format that can be utilized by machine learning algorithms. By completing this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in:

- Preprocessing textual data for NLP tasks.
- Calculating Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).
- Combining TF and IDF to generate TF-IDF scores for each word in the corpus.
- Applying the TF-IDF matrix to analyze and classify textual data.

## **Content**
The exercise is structured into several key sections:

1. **Data Preparation**: This section focuses on loading and preprocessing the text data. Common preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and lowercasing are performed to clean the data before applying TF-IDF.

2. **TF-IDF Computation**: Here, you will learn how to compute Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for the text data. These computations are then combined to generate the TF-IDF matrix, which quantifies the importance of each word in a document relative to the entire corpus.

3. **Text Analysis and Classification**: In this section, the TF-IDF matrix is utilized to analyze and classify the text data. This includes identifying significant words and their impact on document classification, as well as visualizing the results.

4. **Evaluation**: The final section involves evaluating the performance of the TF-IDF-based model. You will explore how effectively the TF-IDF features contribute to the accuracy and reliability of text classification models.

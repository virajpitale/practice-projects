# NLP with SpaCy: Word Embeddings Exercise

## Overview

This project is part of a series exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using SpaCy, a popular Python library for NLP. The focus of this exercise is on word embeddings, which are powerful tools for capturing the semantic meaning of words in a numerical format that can be processed by machine learning models.

## Objectives

- **Understand Word Embeddings**: Learn the concept of word embeddings and their significance in NLP.
- **Implement Word Embeddings with SpaCy**: Use SpaCy to generate and manipulate word embeddings.
- **Explore Relationships Between Words**: Analyze the semantic similarities and relationships between words based on their embeddings.
- **Apply Embeddings to NLP Tasks**: Utilize word embeddings in various NLP tasks to see their practical applications.

## Structure

- **Introduction**: A brief explanation of word embeddings, why they are important, and how they are used in NLP.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Steps for loading and preparing text data for generating word embeddings.
- **Word Embedding Generation**: Using SpaCy to create word embeddings and visualize them.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Techniques for exploring the relationships between different words using their embeddings.
- **Application**: Applying the embeddings to solve specific NLP tasks, such as text classification or sentiment analysis.
- **Evaluation**: Analyzing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics like confusion matrices.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- SpaCy

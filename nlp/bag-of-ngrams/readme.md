# News Classification Using Bag of N-grams

## Project Overview

This project is a practice exercise in my Natural Language Processing (NLP) journey. The objective is to classify news articles as either "Fake" or "Real" using a bag-of-ngrams approach. The dataset used contains text from various news articles, and the project involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, and building a machine learning model to classify the articles.
